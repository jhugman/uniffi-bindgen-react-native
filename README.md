# uniffi-bindgen-react-native
[UniFFI](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/latest/) is a multi-language bindings generator for Rust.

This project, `uniffi-bindgen-react-native`, is a uniFFI bindings generator for using Rust from React Native.

It provides tooling to generate:

- Typescript and JSI C++ to call Rust from Typescript and back again
- a Turbo-Module that installs the bindings into a running React Native library.

If you're ready to start, then start with [a step-by-step tutorial to make a Rust turbo-module](https://jhugman.github.io/uniffi-bindgen-react-native/).

If you're new to uniFFI, then [**the UniFFI user guide**](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/latest/)
or [**the UniFFI examples**](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/tree/main/examples#example-uniffi-components) are interesting places to start.
